# Research ideas about Ph.D.

## Vitamin D and COVID-19

-   Currently working on pharmacy thesis about Vitamin D and COVID-19

-   Both the incidence and severity of COVID-19 are epidemiologically
    associated with VitD deficiency/insufficiency

-   Strong relationship between immune tolerance and (insufficient)
    vitamin D levels: ubiquitous VDR + key cytokines and transcription
    factors

-   Vitamin D surprisingly plays many roles:

    -   cardiovascular system (thrombotic events);

    -   Immune tolerance and immune health;

    -   Renin Angiotensin System (lung injury, cardiovascular,
        inflammation);

    -   Protection against acute respiratory lung infections;

        -   Implication: Vitamin D **reshapes the epigenetic landscape**
            of (immune) cells [@Chauss.2022]

-   New research literature since 2011 (IOM) show that there might be a
    need to increase VitD levels (from 20-30 ng/ml) to at least 40 ng/mL
    for immunological benefits

### Further explore links between VitD and COVID-19 through bioinformatical approach

COVID-19

- Use spatial transcriptomics to investigate and identify lymphocytes types/states in relation to inflammation? 

## Depression and inflammation

-   Literature research state serotonin theory has nothing to depression
    [@Lacasse.2005; @Cowen.2015 ; @Moncrieff.2022].
    
- Hypothesis of depression linked to elevated brain inflammation [@Liu.2017 ; @Kubera.2011]

- SSRI are actually anti-inflammatory [@Taler.2007]

- Brain: Examining relationship between elevated brain inflammation and depression disorders with possible links to treatment resistant depression, on an individualized level

<!-- > Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) is a powerful technology to map the -->
<!-- molecular space in 2D. Our lab is using a wide range of ST technologies -->
<!-- to investigate how drugs are delivered to various organs including tumor -->
<!-- mass at the single cell resolution. -->

<!-- > We are looking for excellent candidates willing to investigate various -->
<!-- in vivo drug delivery vehicles to learn latest bioinformatics tools to -->
<!-- develop efficient and cell-specific drug delivery tools. -->


> The advancement in molecular profiling of biological samples has made it possible to profile patient samples to uncover omics at multiple modalities and scales, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, microbiome, lipidomics, pharmacogenomics, pharmacokinetics and phenomics measured across multiple scales from a single cell to tissue and to the whole body, and under different states of health, treatment timepoints and disease progression. This coupled with electronic health records of patient diagnosis, history and assessments, and additional factors of diet, lifestyle and environment can potentially unravel the predisposition, treatment response and progression of different diseases in each individual. 
> Additionally, the vast amount of information from published literature, public data, disease ontology can be mined and integrated with the clinical and research data to create a holistic disease profile of each patient. When integrated across large patient cohorts of heterogenous profiles, we can uncover novel therapeutics and biomarkers that targets and stratifies specific patient subgroup. The sheer volume and complexity of data gathered requires development of novel machine learning approaches and knowledge graphs to integrate the multimodal and multiscale biomedical and research data to uncover new biological mechanisms and panel of features to predict the right precision medicine strategies.
